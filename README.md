### Installation

Install [Node Package Manager (NPM)] and [Node.js] to run.

To check if you have Node.js installed correctly, run this command in your terminal:
```sh
$ node -v
```

To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:
```sh
$ npm -v
```

To install most of the dependencies we will make use of [Yarn] package manager. [Yarn] is a super set of [Node Package Manager (NPM)], which install dependencies in parallel, secure and reliable manner.

Install [Yarn] globally by using the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global yarn
```

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ yarn
```

### Server

Format for passing argument to npm script
```sh
npm run <command> [-- <args>]
```

Here are multiple ways to run the server
```sh
$ npm start -s (Recommended Default Port 8080)
$ npm run server -- -p 8080 (Pick Any Available Port No)
```



### Logging Techniques

The common approach to log the output in Node is to use console.log()
A better approach is to use [Winston] logging methods
